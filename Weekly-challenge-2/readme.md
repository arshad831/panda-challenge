# Question
Develop a Python script that analyzes data from digital marketing campaigns to optimize the allocation of budget across various channels to maximize ROI (Return on Investment). 


The script should take into account the performance metrics of each channel (e.g., click-through rate, conversion rate, and cost per acquisition) and the constraints on the total budget. 

Additionally, generate visualizations to display the performance metrics of each channel and the proposed budget allocations. Share your GitHub solution in the comments to participate.

The dataset marketing_data_sample_corrected.csv can be found here  https://nas.io/artificialintelligence/tbon

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine along with the required libraries, namely pandas and matplotlib. You can install them using pip:
    ```
    pip install pandas matplotlib
    ```
3. **Prepare Data**: Ensure you have the marketing data in a CSV file named "marketing_data_sample_corrected.csv" placed in the same directory as the script.
4. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script `python_script.py`. This will read the data, perform the analysis, and generate visualizations to display the performance metrics and proposed budget allocations.

## File Description
- `python_script.py`: The Python script that performs the analysis on the marketing data.
- `marketing_data_sample_corrected.csv`: Sample CSV file containing marketing data (impressions, clicks, conversions, total cost) for various channels.

## Output
The script generates several visualizations to display the following:
- Average impressions, clicks, and conversions for each marketing channel.
- Total cost per channel.
- Click-through rate (CTR) for each channel.
- Conversion rate for each channel.
- Combined metric for budget allocation optimization, along with annotations indicating channels where increasing the budget could potentially increase ROI.
